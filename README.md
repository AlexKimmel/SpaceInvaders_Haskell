# SpaceInvaders_Haskell

This is a project of the 2022/2023 Funktional Programming course at the TUHH.

Within the time span of two week we (a team of 4) were tasked to creat a visual Haskell program 
which runs on a 360 pixel Screen made out of beer crates.

## Idea

The idea is to creat a bare bones, vertical version of the arcade game Space Invaders.
This will include:
    - Player Movement
    - Player Shooting
    - Enemy Spawning 
    - Enemy Movement 
    - Enemy Shooting 
    - Score System 
    - Collisions 
These Tasks will be equally distributed between the 4 members
