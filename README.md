# SpaceInvaders_Haskell

This is a project of the 2022/2023 Funktional Programming course at the TUHH.

Within the time span of two week we (a team of 4) were tasked to creat a visual Haskell program 
which runs on a 360 pixel Screen made out of beer crates.

## Idea

The idea is to creat a bare bones, horizontal version of the arcade game Space Invaders.
This will include: 

Player Movement, Shooting, 
Enemy Spawning, Movement, Shooting (including different types of Enemys) 
Score System, life system (player lossing lifes when shoot, touched or enemy escaping) 
and Collisions between player, enemy and bullets from both

 
These tasks will be equally distributed between the 4 members of the team
