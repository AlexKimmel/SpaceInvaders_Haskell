# SpaceInvaders_Haskell

This is a project of the 2022/2023 Funktional Programming course at the TUHH.

Within the time span of two week we (a team of 4) were tasked to creat a visual Haskell program 
which runs on a 360 pixel Screen made out of beer crates.

## Idea

The idea is to creat a bare bones, horizontal version of the arcade game Space Invaders.<br />
This will include: 

Player Movement, Shooting, <br />
Enemy Spawning (in waves), Movement, Shooting (including different types of Enemys) <br />

Score System, life system (player lossing lifes when shoot, touched or enemy escaping) <br />

and Collisions between player, enemy and bullets from both<br />

 
These tasks will be equally distributed between the 4 members of the team
